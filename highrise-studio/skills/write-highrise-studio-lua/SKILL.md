# Write Highrise Studio Lua code

This guide covers how to write Highrise Studio Lua code.

## Instructions

Add the following steps to your todo list:
1. Search for and read any relevant scripts in the project, if needed.
2. Ask the user for any information that is needed to solve the request.
3. If starting a new script, copy the code from the [style guide](resources/STYLE_GUIDE.lua) as a starting template.
4. Write the code, following these imperatives:
    - Rely on the `research-highrise-studio-lua-api` skill to understand the Highrise Studio API.
    - Do **not** use Unity C#, MonoBehaviour, or Roblox APIs unless specified in the Highrise Studio API docs. **There is no such thing as `task`.**
    - Avoid browser or DOM references (`document`, `window`, `addEventListener`, etc.).
    - If you are ever unsure about how to do something, **read the docs.**
5. Remove any unnecessary sections and comments from any scripts you created.
